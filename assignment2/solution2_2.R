# Problem 2
# Write an R script that takes two arguments: (1) a fasta file name, (2) a sequence ID.
# script should print out the sequence matching the id in FASTA format to the terminal.

# I was unclear of the directions but I'm assuming this was to write a hypothetical script.
for (i in 1:(find(what = "*.fa"))) {
  if(ID = "x") {
    cat(i)
    print()
