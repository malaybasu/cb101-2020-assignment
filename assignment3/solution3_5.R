#Problem 5: Fermi estimation. How many liters of melted chocolate would be needed to cover enough cashews to cover a football field?

# Assumptions: area of a single cashew is ~0.25 inches and mL chocolate needed to cover one cashew is 2 mL (0.002L).

# football field is ~ 300 feet long x 160 feet wide or ~3500 inches by 2000 inches
# total area of a football field is ~ 7 x 10^6 inches
# Cashews needed to cover the area of a football field is ~ 7 x 10^6 / 0.25 = 2.8 x 10 ^7

# Volume of chocolate needed to cover enough cashews to cover a football field would be:

# 2.8 x 10^7 * 0.002L = 56,000 Liters
