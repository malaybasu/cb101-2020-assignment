fermi estimation problem

In one minute, how many neurons fire in the human body?
  
first we must esimate the number of neurons
  
There are about 10^11 neurons in the brain


Is the number of neurons in organs and nerves large enough to effect our estimates?

There are about 20 vertebrae and a nerve which arises off of each side of the vertebrae, thus there are 40 large nerve trunks

Even if each nerve has 100,000 neurons in it, there are only 4,000,000 (4x 10 ^6) neurons in the peripheral nervous system

THus, the total neumber of neurons in the body is still approxiately 10^11


Next, we must determien how many are frequently firing and how often they fire within a brief interval.

The avearge action potential lasts appoxmiately 5 msec

there are 60 seconds in a minute, and 1000 msecs in a second; thus, any neuron in theory has the capacity to fire 1200 times in a minute

It's been esteimated that 90% of neurons rarely fire, thus, only 10% of 10^11 neurons are likly to fire in any given one minute interval=10^10

Let's assume the odds of any of the remaining neuron firing over any 5msec interval are low : 1/100,000 (low average rates of activity are important to protect against seizures)

However, over a given minute, they have the opporutnity to fire 1200 times, thus, over the a single minute the probability is three orders of magnitude better, about 1/100

Thus, over the course ofsingle minute, 1.0% of the 10^10 neurons fire; or 10^8 neurons (100 million neurons)

interestinly, that's about the number of neurons in a mouse brain, which has 70,000,000. so you could say we are using the equivalent of a mouses entire nervous system in any one minute interval.
