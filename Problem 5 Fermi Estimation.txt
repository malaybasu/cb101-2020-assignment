Fermi EstimationReal-life Fermi Estimation I used for my lab work: How much GK1.5 anti-CD4 antibody is needed to exactly deplete 100% CD4 T cells in a mouse?I used this paper to estimate total # of CD4 molecules per T cell to be 98,000. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9773880/I also assumed 1x10^8 total T cells and ~70% of these should be CD4+. https://www.jimmunol.org/content/164/11/5782#:~:text=The%20total%20number%20of%20T,given%20time%20in%20a%20mouse.Based on that, I arrived at this: 1.00E+08Total T cells7.00E+07Total CD4 T cells 6.86E+12Total CD4 molecules6.86E+12Total GK1.5 molecules needed (based on MW of antibody) 1.14E-11mols GK1.5 needed1.71 ugtheoretical depleting dose A more boring Fermi Estimation… How many beats will your heart make in a lifetime?60-100 beats per minute = average heart rate 72.6 years = average life expectancy (UN, 2019) 365 days = year 24 hours = day 60 minutes = hour365 days/year X 24 hours/day X 60 minutes/hour = 525600 minutes in a year 72.6 years X 525600 minutes = 38,158,560 minutes38,158,560 minutes X 60 beats/minute = 2.29e9 beats 38,158,560 minutes X 100 beats/minute = 3.82e9 beats So the average person’s heart will beat 2.3 to 3.8 BILLION times in the their lifetime
